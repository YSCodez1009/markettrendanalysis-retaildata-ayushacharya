# Market Trend Analysis and Sales Forecasting

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to extract meaningful business insights and forecast future sales trends using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making in areas such as inventory planning, demand forecasting, and marketing strategy.

---

## Project Track
**Data Analytics and Machine Learning**

---

## Problem Statement
Retail organizations generate large volumes of transactional data, but often lack structured analytical approaches to understand customer behavior, seasonal demand variations, and key revenue drivers. This project addresses this gap by applying machine learning and time-series analysis to historical sales data.

---

## Dataset Description
- **Source:** Public retail sales dataset  
- **Type:** Historical transactional data  
- **Contents:** Customer demographics, product categories, pricing, quantities, and transaction dates  
- **Usage:** Academic and analytical purposes  

---

## Methodology
The project follows a structured analytics pipeline:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Correlation analysis
4. Feature engineering
5. Model training and prediction
6. Sales forecasting and evaluation

---

## Models and Techniques Used
- **Machine Learning:**  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - XGBoost Regressor  
- **Deep Learning:**  
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time-series forecasting  

---

## Evaluation Approach
- Quantitative metrics such as MAE and RMSE were used for regression evaluation
- Qualitative analysis was performed using visual comparison of actual vs predicted sales trends
- Model limitations and assumptions were documented

---

## Key Results
- Identified customer demographic and category-wise sales trends
- Detected strong seasonal patterns in sales data
- Successfully forecasted future sales using machine learning models

---

## Ethical Considerations
- Acknowledges potential bias due to dataset limitations
- Ensures responsible use of AI for decision support rather than automated decision-making
- Highlights the importance of human oversight in real-world deployment

---

## Repository Structure
- `MarketTrendAnalysisProject (2).ipynb` – Main project notebook (source of truth)
- `README.md` – Project documentation

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom

---

## Future Scope
- Incorporate external factors such as promotions, holidays, and economic indicators
- Experiment with advanced forecasting models
- Deploy the solution as an interactive dashboard or real-time analytics system
